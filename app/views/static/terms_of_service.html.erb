      <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are part of the User Agreement– a legally binding contract governing your use of ChurpSocial. <b>You should read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) in full, but here are a few key things you should take away:</b></p>

              You are responsible for your use of the Services and your Content. You must comply with this User Agreement, its incorporated policies, 
              and all applicable laws.

              available, published interfaces that we provide. For example, this means that you cannot scrape the Services, try to work around any technical 
              limitations we impose, or otherwise attempt to disrupt the operation of the Services.&nbsp;</p>

              such as, for example, removing your Content, limiting visibility, discontinuing your access to ChurpSocial, or taking legal action. 
              We may also suspend or terminate your account for other reasons, such as prolonged inactivity, risk of legal exposure, or commercial inviability.&nbsp;

              us with a broad, royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. Conversely, we provide you a 
              license to use the software we provide as part of the Services, such as the ChurpSocial mobile application, solely for the purpose of enabling you to use 
              and enjoy the benefit of the Services.&nbsp;

              your account and discontinuing use of the Services. Note that we will not be liable for certain types of damages as described in the agreement, and in any 
              event, our aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of $100 USD or the amount you paid us, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving 
              rise to the claim. Further, if you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, the reporting process is 
              detailed in these Terms.&nbsp;
